print(max(22.2,121.3,132.2,2.3,34.3))    #in the same way it will work on float values also.



#Min

#2. it will work on int and float numbers.

print(min(20,332,24,24,3354,3531,35,3253)) # it wil return which is minimum number in given numbers.

print(max(22.2,121.3,132.2,2.3,34.3))    #in the same way it will work on float values also.

#min and max with strings

#min
str="this"
print(min(str))  #we can find the min string based on which will come first in the alphabets.
                 # we should give any space when we are using min function.

#max

str="this"
print(max(str))    #we can find the min string based on which will come first in the alphabets.
                 # we should give any space when we are using min function.
