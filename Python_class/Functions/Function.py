#function

#1. A function is a bloke of code which runs only when it has been called.
#2. we can pass the date by using paramaters into the function
#3. we can get ruture data as result.

# we can use "def" as key word to define a function

#example

#def my_function():
    #some code
    # return #some code

#parameters

#we can pass the data into function by using of parameters.
#if we give 3 paramaters we should give 3 inputs for it, not less or not more.

def my_function(name,age,loction):
    print("my",name,"yanamala, i am",age,"old, and i am from",loction)

print(my_function("Raja",27,"nellore"))

#paramaters and arguments

#paramaters and arguments are both are same thing, we use them for pass the data into function.
