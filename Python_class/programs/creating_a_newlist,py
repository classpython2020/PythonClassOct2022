#Create a new list from a two list using the following condition

#Given a two list of numbers, write a program to create a new list such that the new list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

#Given:

#list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
#list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]
