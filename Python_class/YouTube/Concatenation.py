#concatention

#1.concatenation means we can add two elements which are belongs to same data type.
#2.we can do concatenation by using the + operator.
#3.true has value in python (1).
#4.False had value in pythin (0).
#5.We can'nt add two elements from different data tyes.


#1.it will add two elements from same data type.

a=15
b=10
print(a+b)
  #10 is an int and 15.5 is a float but still we can do concatination becuase both are belongs to numaric data type.
a=10
b=15.5
print(a+b)

print('hello'*'world')   #here we can do concatenation

#2.true has value in python (1)

print(True+2)   #true has value of one

#3.False had value in pythin (0)

print(False+3)  #False has 0 value

#4.We can'nt add two elements from different data tyes.

print(5+'hello')   # 5 is a int and hello is a string we can not concatinate between two different data types.

print(True+'hello')  #even true has value of one so can not concatinate between two different data types.
