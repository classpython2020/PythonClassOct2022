#Variable and Data Type


#Variables are containers for storing data values.
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

#Rule of variable

# we can use anything as variable but it should start with letter after that we can keep numbers.
#we can not use any special charecters in the variable but we can use underscore.
#but not in the starting but we can use between the words.

#examples

ver=123  #lower case
VER=123  #upper case

ver1=123 #we can use numbers after the starting letter

ver_type=123 # we can use underscore anywhere in the variable
_ver=123


#How we should'nt use

#2ver=123  # we will get error

#&ver=123
