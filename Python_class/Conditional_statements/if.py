# if statment

#if test expression:
   # print()

#if statement

#we can use the logical conditions with if statement,


#we will use logical conditions with if statement,


#Equals: a == b
#Not Equals: a != b
#Less than: a < b
#Less than or equal to: a <= b
#Greater than: a > b
#Greater than or equal to: a >= b

#we can use these coonditions in several ways in if statement and loops.
#we can write if statement by using the "if" keyword.

#Example
#If statement:

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

# it will give the output but if condition is fail still it will pass but we can'nt get any output
# for that we need to use else

#short hand if
#if we have only one statement to excute, we can out in the same line as if condition.

#example

a=40
b=30
if a>b: print("a is greater than b")

#Elif

#Elif means in python way of saying if previous condition is not true then try this condition.

#example

a=40
b=30
if a<b:
  print("a is lessthen b")
elif a>b:
  print("a grater than b")
else:
  print("both are wrong")
